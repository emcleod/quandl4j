Contributing to Quandl4J
========================

We welcome helpful contributions, feature requests and bug reports.  The preferred channel for reporting these
issues is via the [issue tracker](http://github.com/jimmoores/quandl4j/issues).

### Bug Reports
Bug reports should contain a repeatable, demonstrable problem.  Good bug reports are very useful!  Guidelines 
for bug reports:
 - Use the GitHub issue search to check if someone else has already reported the bug.
 - Check if the issue has already been fixed in a newer version.
 - Try to isolate the problem in the smallest possible example, ideally creating a minimal test case that
   can be run independently from your development infrastructure.
 - Bear in mind that Quandl4J is a wrapper for the Quandl REST API so some issues will by definition be 
   caused by the underlying API.
 - Include as much detail as possible about your setup - OS, Java version, Maven version, Quandl4J version, etc.

### Feature requests
Feature requests are welcome.

### Pull requests
Good pull requests -- patches, improvements and new features are hugely welcome.  Having said that, please ask 
before undertaking **significant** new feature requests as sometimes the existing contributors will have plans
to implement certain features in certain ways.  By asking in advance you avoid the possibility of being annoyed
or disappointed if your planned change isn't appropriate.

If you do decide to contribute, it is very important in particular to adhere to the coding guidelines already
used in the project:
  - Code formatting style (2-space indent, etc).
  - Javadocs on all public constants, instances, methods, interfaces, classes and packages.
  - Pass checkstyle checks.
Please ask for more information.
